 * A DoubleBlockingQueuing is a queue that is made to support multiple threads

 * A DoubleBlockingQueue differs from a BlockingQueue because it blocks adding
 * threads if the queue becomes to large as well as blocking getter threads if
 * the queue has no items. A DoubleBlockingQueue of length 0 is sometimes known
 * as a rendezvous point/variable or as a simple channel.
