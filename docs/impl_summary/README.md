# Implementation Summaries

This folder contains post-implementation reports generated by the Implementation Agent after executing a plan from `docs/plans/`.

## Purpose

Implementation summaries capture:
- What was actually implemented
- Files changed
- Key design decisions made during implementation
- Deviations from the original plan (with rationale)
- Tests added/updated
- Javadoc and design docs updated
- Known issues or follow-up work needed

## Naming

Each summary file should match its corresponding plan:
- Plan: `docs/plans/<feature-slug>.md`
- Summary: `docs/impl_summary/<feature-slug>.md`

Examples:
- `docs/impl_summary/add-mdns-discovery-ui.md`
- `docs/impl_summary/client-window-remember-type.md`

## When to write

The Implementation Agent writes a summary **after** completing all code changes, doc updates, and tests for a given plan.

## What to include

- **Brief overview**: What was implemented (1-2 sentences)
- **Files changed**: List of modified/added files
- **Key decisions**: Design choices made during implementation
- **Tests**: What tests were added or updated
- **Docs updated**: Javadoc changes, design doc updates
- **Deviations**: Any differences from the plan (with why)
- **Follow-up**: Known issues, tech debt, or future work
