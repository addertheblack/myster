#In Java Util Logging (JUL), loggers and handlers have associated logging levels that determine which 
#log messages are recorded or ignored. The levels are, in ascending order of severity:
#
#    SEVERE (highest value)
#    WARNING
#    INFO
#    CONFIG
#    FINE
#    FINER
#    FINEST (lowest value)
#    ALL (intended to log all messages)
#    OFF (intended to turn off logging)
#
#When you set the logging level to ALL, it logs messages of all levels, including FINE, FINER, 
#FINEST, and others generated by the JVM or any libraries you are using. This is why you're seeing 
#extensive logging output, including internal JVM logs.

# Set the global logging level to ALL
.level = INFO
#com.yourpackage.level = INFO

# Specify the default ConsoleHandler to output to the console
handlers = com.myster.CustomConsoleHandler

# Use a simple format for ConsoleHandler
com.myster.CustomConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

# Optionally, customize the output format
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format = %1$tF %1$tT.%1$tL %4$s %5$s %n

# either "err" or "out" is supported
com.myster.CustomConsoleHandler.output = out

# Put custom logger levels in here Don't forget ".level"
com.myster.CustomConsoleHandler.level = ALL
#java.awt.event.EventDispatchThread.level = FINE
